# inDecentScale
ESP32-based scale that emulates a "Decent Scale" via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), offering features like weight measurement, autotare, timer control, and power-off sequencing

Why? For use with Apps like Beanconqueror, etc. 

### STATUS: Currently in Prototyping stage!

## Disclaimer: this code has not been tested!
There may be (probably a lot of) bugs and errors! You have been warned.
